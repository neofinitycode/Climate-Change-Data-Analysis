# Climate  Change Data  Analysis
 
Performed Data Analysis on the datasets-
1. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data">Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data</a>

In this dataset, we have include several files:<br />
Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures (GlobalTemperatures.csv):<br />
Date: starts in 1750 for average land temperature and 1850 for max and min land temperatures and global ocean and land temperatures<br />
LandAverageTemperature: global average land temperature in celsius<br />
LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the average<br />
LandMaxTemperature: global average maximum land temperature in celsius<br />
LandMaxTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the maximum land temperature<br />
LandMinTemperature: global average minimum land temperature in celsius<br />
LandMinTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the minimum land temperature<br />
LandAndOceanAverageTemperature: global average land and ocean temperature in celsius<br />
LandAndOceanAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the global average land and ocean temperature<br />
Other files include:<br />
Global Average Land Temperature by Country (GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv)<br />
Global Average Land Temperature by State (GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv)<br />
Global Land Temperatures By Major City (GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.csv)<br />
Global Land Temperatures By City (GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv)<br />
The raw data comes from theÂ Berkeley Earth data page.<br />




2. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ucsandiego/carbon-dioxide">Carbon Dioxide Levels in Atmosphere</a>

This dataset includes a monthly observation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (or CO2) concentrations from the Mauna Loa Observatory (Hawaii) at a latitude of 19.5, longitude of -155.6, and elevation of 3397 meters.<br />

Columns 1-3: Provide the date in the following redundant formats: year, month and decimal date<br />
Column 4: Monthly CO2 concentrations in parts per million (ppm) measured on the 08A calibration scale and collected at 24:00 hours on the fifteenth of each month.<br />
Column 5: The fifth column provides the same data after a seasonal adjustment, which involves subtracting from the data a 4-harmonic fit with a linear gain factor to remove the seasonal cycle from carbon dioxide measurements<br />
Column 6: The sixth column provides the data with noise removed, generated from a stiff cubic spline function plus 4-harmonic functions with linear gain<br />
Column 7: The seventh column is the same data with the seasonal cycle removed.<br />
