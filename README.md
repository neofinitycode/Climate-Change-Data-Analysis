# Climate  Change Data  Analysis
 
Performed Data Analysis on the datasets-
1. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data">Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data</a>
In this dataset, we have include several files:

Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures (GlobalTemperatures.csv):

Date: starts in 1750 for average land temperature and 1850 for max and min land temperatures and global ocean and land temperatures
LandAverageTemperature: global average land temperature in celsius
LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the average
LandMaxTemperature: global average maximum land temperature in celsius
LandMaxTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the maximum land temperature
LandMinTemperature: global average minimum land temperature in celsius
LandMinTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the minimum land temperature
LandAndOceanAverageTemperature: global average land and ocean temperature in celsius
LandAndOceanAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the global average land and ocean temperature
Other files include:

Global Average Land Temperature by Country (GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv)
Global Average Land Temperature by State (GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv)
Global Land Temperatures By Major City (GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.csv)
Global Land Temperatures By City (GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv)
The raw data comes from the Berkeley Earth data page.



2. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ucsandiego/carbon-dioxide">Carbon Dioxide Levels in Atmosphere</a>
This dataset includes a monthly observation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (or CO2) concentrations from the Mauna Loa Observatory (Hawaii) at a latitude of 19.5, longitude of -155.6, and elevation of 3397 meters.

Columns 1-3: Provide the date in the following redundant formats: year, month and decimal date
Column 4: Monthly CO2 concentrations in parts per million (ppm) measured on the 08A calibration scale and collected at 24:00 hours on the fifteenth of each month.
Column 5: The fifth column provides the same data after a seasonal adjustment, which involves subtracting from the data a 4-harmonic fit with a linear gain factor to remove the seasonal cycle from carbon dioxide measurements
Column 6: The sixth column provides the data with noise removed, generated from a stiff cubic spline function plus 4-harmonic functions with linear gain
Column 7: The seventh column is the same data with the seasonal cycle removed.
